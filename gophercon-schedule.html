It will cover things like use of the Go profiler, the go test benchmarks, runtime behavior, cgo, compiler optimisation/inlining, go's asm support, and some implementation details for maps, channels, the runtime and the select statement. It's intended for intermediate to experienced gophers, although beginners who are more or less familiar with the language features will certainly be able to follow along.</p>			<p>Though much of the talk is about optimising at a low level, there will be an exploration of how to structure programs to make them easier to profile, reason about, and optimise. There will be benchmarks as well as exploration of the behavior of the underlying code explaining their results. This will not stray too far into the philosophy of composition; it will be mostly technical, with only a few unremarkable but important overarching points. People should hopefully come away with understanding something new about the implementation of the Go language itself, how it impacts the runtime speed of Go programs, and perhaps how these might change in future.</p>            <p>Some of the material I plan to present will be similar to that covered in my "<a href="http://jmoiron.net/blog/go-performance-tales" target="_blank">Go Performance Tales</a>" and "<a href="http://jmoiron.net/blog/whats-going-on/" target="_blank">What's Going On</a>" blog posts, but updated with new insights or details.</p>		</div>		<div class="col-sm-4">			<div class="image-box" style="background-image:url(/images/speakers/jason-moiron.jpg)"></div>			<span class="name">Jason Moiron</span>            <span class="company"><a href="https://twitter.com/jmoiron" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i> @jmoiron</a></span>			<hr />            <div class="speaker-desc">				Jason is an engineer at Datadog, a saas monitoring service for IT and operations teams based in New York City.

I have studied a lot of things from this mistake and I want to share them with other Go users by using practical and concrete examples. I'll talk these tips for beginners of Go who will create their own Go package in the future. These are some examples of these tips:</p>        <ul>			<li>Set a public accessibility to variables and functions which you REALLY want to make public</li>			<li>Have a public function get an "Options" struct instead of many configuration parameters for the future extension</li>			<li>Divide a struct which has many kinds of types/modes into small structs by making use of an interface and a struct embedment feature of Go</li>			<li>Tips for achieving 100% of test coverage</li>			<li>Why is 100% of test coverage is important?: Test of Regression &amp; Detection of Race Condition</li>			<li>Don't write test codes at the end, write them in parallel with program codes</li>			<li>Tools for writing Go source code successfully: goimports, golint</li>			<li>Define error constants if we can</li>			<li>Be careful to the difference between OSs when check error messages</li>			<li>Build CI environments of Windows and Linux</li>		</ul>		</div>		<div class="col-sm-4">			<div class="image-box" style="background-image:url(/images/speakers/keiji-yoshida.jpg)"></div>			<span class="name">Keiji Yoshida</span>            <span class="company"><a href="https://twitter.com/_yosssi" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i> @_yosssi</a></span>			<hr />            <div class="speaker-desc">				Keiji Yoshida is a software engineer at an IT service provider in Japan.

Aerospike has been among the fore-runners of integrating a more involved part of the data access library in its Smart Clients.

Research communities dealing with a lot of simulations usually don't use advanced programming techniques for thier work. They usually rely on third party tools like Matlab, octave and R or native languages like C/C++. Especially, in the area of wireless research, to capture a 1 minute snapshot of a 4G communication system of 500+ users and 50 base-stations typically takes about a weeks time. In a system level simulation, there are lot of functionalities that can be executed concurrently. The simplicity of Go's concurrency can help accelerate the coding and simulation times.<br /><br />We noticed a performance improvement of 2x when compared to a C code for a simple wireless point-to-point link simulation (QPSK AWGN). This motivated us to build a full-fledged simulation platform based on golang, which can be hosted on cloud services like GCE.

The technique is capable of producing high quality images but requires great computational costs.

I will show how the language syntax and features and the built-in concurrency support makes Go a perfect choice.</p>		</div>		<div class="col-sm-4">			<div class="image-box" style="background-image:url(/images/speakers/guillaume-j-charmes.jpg)"></div>			<span class="name">Guillaume J.

He loves to travel and used to live in France, China, Russia, RÃ©union, San Francisco, Chicago and Miami. He also likes to travel between technologies and languages: He jumped from C and ASM to PHP to fall into Python to then migrate to Go with some sides of Ruby. He is coming from a low-level ASM/C background which he uses to teach as well as for web security.								He started using Go since 2009 and fell in love with the syntax and concurrency model. He joined dotCloud, inc where he was the only Go developer for a while. This is when they started Docker..., in Go. Arrived to Docker 1.0, he moved on to Citrix, Inc under the sun of Florida where he helps the moving process from Ruby to Go.			</div>	    </div>		</div>      </div>    </div>  </div></div></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> 4.30 PM</td>			<td><a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#dave">Closing Keynote: Simplicity and the ideas that Go left behind - Dave Cheney</a><div class="modal fade bs-example-modal-lg" id="dave" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="myModalLabel" aria-hidden="true">  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">    <div class="modal-content">      <div class="modal-body">		<button type="button" class="close pull-right" data-dismiss="modal"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span><span class="sr-only">Close</span></button>        <div class="rows clearfix">		<div class="col-sm-8">			<h2 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Closing Keynote - Simplicity and the ideas that Go left behind</h2>			<div class="modal-desc">				<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></i> Saturday 21st February, 2015 &nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> 4:30 pm to 5:15 pm (IST)			</div>			<p>A discussion on ideas which Go's designers decided to leave _out_ of the language and the effect of those decisions on a language designed for simplicity and scale.</p>		</div>		<div class="col-sm-4">			<div class="image-box" style="background-image:url(/images/speakers/dave.cheney.jpg)"></div>			<span class="name">Dave Cheney</span>            <span class="company"><a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i> @davecheney</a></span>			<hr />            <div class="speaker-desc">				Dave is an Australian speaker, blogger, and open source author.
